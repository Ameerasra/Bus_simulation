# Bus_simulation
To analyze the bus systemâ€™s performance effectively, a discrete-event simulation (DES) model was developed using the SimPy library in Python. This modeling approach allows precise representation of real-world asynchronous events such as passenger arrivals, bus arrivals, boarding activities, and departures.
